## **1. Preliminaries**

### 1.1 Background

Artificial intelligence is one of the most active research fields in recent years. Chess is an important branch of artificial intelligence research and with the development of game algorithms, more and more AI "chess players" have been created, such as AlphaGo. Reversi is a widespread and popular foreign board game. The game, which has simple and changeable rules, is full of interesting and recreational. Reversi is played by flipping each other's pieces between the piece you just played and any of your old pieces, and after the board is full filled, the player with more pieces left wins the game. Reversed-Reversi, the game in our project, has the same rules as Reversi except for the way to determine the winner, which is that fewer pieces in the end means victory. The purpose of this project is to build a Reversed-Reversi artificial intelligence based on game algorithms.

1.2 Technology

To construct the game search tree search, including the realization of the main search algorithm 2. Construct the dynamic evaluation method of black and white chess situation, including the evaluation of action power, the dynamic evaluation of position value, the evaluation of the early situation, the evaluation of the middle situation, and the evaluation of the late situation

Can computer chess, so that it can play against opponents. Visual C+ is used here

\+ 6.0 game design black and white procedures, the application of Alpha - Beta pruning and

Maxima minima principle to search the best position.
